{"context_length": 46, "output_length": 1650, "decoded_output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. If the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches, what is the perimeter of the regular hexagon? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know a regular hexagon is a six-sided polygon where all the sides are equal in length and all the angles are equal too. It's also mentioned that it can be divided into six equilateral triangles. I'm picturing a regular hexagon, like the ones you sometimes see in beehives or in the center of a circle. Yeah, and each of those triangles must be equilateral, meaning all their sides are the same length.\n\nSo, if each triangle is equilateral, then all their sides are equal, and since the hexagon is made up of six of them, each triangle must be one of the six equal parts. Wait, does that mean each triangle is one of the six congruent triangles that make up the hexagon? I think so. So, if the perimeter of one triangle is 21 inches, I need to find the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the side length of each triangle as 's'. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so each side is 's' inches. The perimeter of the triangle would be 3 times the side length, right? So, if the perimeter is 21 inches, then:\n\n3s = 21\n\nSo, to find the side length 's', I can divide both sides by 3.\n\ns = 21 / 3 = 7 inches.\n\nOkay, so each side of the triangle is 7 inches. Now, since the hexagon is made up of six such triangles, each side of the hexagon must be equal to the side of the triangle, right? Because each triangle contributes one side to the hexagon. So, each side of the hexagon is also 7 inches.\n\nWait, hold on. Is that correct? If each triangle has a side length of 7 inches, and the hexagon is made up of six triangles, does each side of the hexagon correspond directly to one side of the triangle? Let me visualize this.\n\nImagine the regular hexagon divided into six equilateral triangles. If you draw lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices, you'll divide it into six equilateral triangles, each with a central angle of 60 degrees. So, in that case, each triangle's side is the same as the radius of the circumscribed circle around the hexagon. But wait, is that the same as the side length of the hexagon?\n\nActually, in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is equal to the length of each side. So, if each triangle has a side length of 7 inches, that must be the same as the side length of the hexagon. Therefore, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 times the length of one side, right? Since a hexagon has six sides. So, if each side is 7 inches, then the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 7, which is 42 inches.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem says the perimeter of one of the triangles is 21 inches, which is 3s = 21, so s = 7. Then, since the hexagon is made up of six such triangles, each side of the hexagon is 7 inches, so the perimeter is 6 * 7 = 42 inches.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each triangle is equilateral, so each side of the triangle is equal, and each side of the triangle is a side of the hexagon. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches, so perimeter is 6*7=42 inches.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes, when you divide a regular hexagon into triangles, the triangles can be either equilateral or isosceles, depending on how you divide them. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, all the triangles formed by connecting the center to all vertices are equilateral triangles because all sides and angles are equal. So, yes, each triangle is equilateral, so each side of the triangle is equal to the radius, which is equal to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nSo, that must mean that the side length of the hexagon is 7 inches, so the perimeter is 6*7=42 inches.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. If I have a regular hexagon, each side is equal, and when you divide it into six equilateral triangles, each triangle is formed by two radii and a side of the hexagon. So, each triangle is equilateral because all sides are equal, meaning the radius is equal to the side length of the hexagon. So, yes, that would make each side of the triangle equal to the side of the hexagon.\n\nTherefore, since the perimeter of each triangle is 21, each side is 7, so the hexagon's side is 7, so perimeter is 6*7=42 inches.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me do a quick calculation. If each triangle's perimeter is 21, each side is 7, so the side of the hexagon is 7, so 6 sides, 6*7=42. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the area or something else, but no, the problem is asking for the perimeter, so I think it's just 6 times the side length.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the regular hexagon as being composed of six equilateral triangles, then each triangle is one of the six that makes up the hexagon. So, each triangle's perimeter is 21, so each triangle has sides of 7, so each side of the hexagon is 7, so the perimeter is 6*7=42.\n\nYeah, I think that makes sense.\n\nWait, another perspective: if I didn't know that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, I might have to figure it out. But the problem says it can be divided into six equilateral triangles, so that gives me a direct relationship between the triangle's side and the hexagon's side.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, in summary: each triangle has a perimeter of 21, so each side is 7 inches. The regular hexagon is made up of six such triangles, so each side of the hexagon is 7 inches, so the perimeter is 6*7=42 inches.\n\nI don't see any errors in that reasoning, so I think the perimeter of the hexagon is 42 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe perimeter of the regular hexagon is \\boxed{42} inches.\n</think>\n\nA regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Each triangle has a perimeter of 21 inches. To find the side length of each triangle, we start by noting that the perimeter of an equilateral triangle is three times the side length. \n\nLet \\( s \\) be the side length of each triangle. Then:\n\\[\n3s = 21\n\\]\nSolving for \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nSince each side of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the triangles, the side length of the hexagon is also 7 inches. The perimeter of the regular hexagon, which has six sides, is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is \\(\\boxed{42}\\) inches."}
